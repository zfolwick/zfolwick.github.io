What are anti-patterns?
Anti-patterns is a term used to describe the idiotic ways that software can be constructed. They can often lead to intractible issues, also known as "coding oneself into a corner", e.g., making a series of decisions whereby it all becomes terrible and you're left with nowhere you can go.

Resume Driven Development
When software is decided based on the latest hotness.  Blockchain, microservices, AI-powered! No need to think deeply about the project's needs, because if I can just show off my superior skills with my AWS certificate, then people will hire me!

Anxiety Driven Development
When you manage a project or make decisions on what to implement and how it gets implemented.  when you hold meetings "just to get a quick sync".  When every meeting is derailed and people are constantly interrupting over each other, because somehow, them _talking_ is the secret missing thing that is needed for productivity.

Fire Ready Aim Development
FRAD is a software development equivalent of the "there's never time to do it right, but there's always time to do it over".  It can often be paired with Anxiety Driven Development.
