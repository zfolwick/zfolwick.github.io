# A lesson in being explicit

People aren't mind-readers, and their thoughts are equally valid.

I asked my team this:

> In the meantime, in <this code file>, on line 27, please log out the value of the variable, and tell me what it says for you.
 

And I cannot stress how many different ways this can be misinterpreted.  What I _should_ have said was:


> In the meantime, in <this code file>, on line 27, please place this line, and paste what outputs for you:
> console.log(SUPER_INTERESTING_VARIABLE)

The thing is- I _really_ thought I was being explicit in that first message. Different experience levels create different interpretations, as does different levels of attention to details; that doesn't invalidate the interpretation, but it does highlight the need for communicating the groundwork of thoughts that lead to one's actual thought.

One funny example- I tried to read Karl Marx. I got a couple of pages in and he said something hilariously incorrect about the nature of capitalism and proceeded to spend pages and pages fixating on his own incorrect observation, thus creating one of the most frustratingly idiotic system of government in the modern era. But at least he communicated what got him to thinking that the government taking all your shit was a good idea, so we could have a robust discussion around it.

In short- an idea without the antecedents is less valuable than an idea that logically proceeds from stated observations.
